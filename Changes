          ('css' entry).

          valid (big) image that will change the render of the post to a
          full-screen background. The article will then be displayed on a
          transparent white box. Useful for important pages that need to

        * Caching system to avoid recomputing responses from the Blog widget
          (category landing page and permalinks are cached).

          widget and exposes the last 10 published articles of the Blog instance.
          The RSS feed is cached, a restart of the app is needed to refresh it.
        * (Blog) the 'featured_posts' config entry is not mandatory anymore in
          the 'blog-meta.yml' file. If not defined, the last 3 published
          articles are returned instead.

          of the page. Either 'footer' is displayed, or the site title.

        [FIX]
        (CSS) Navigation Bars cleanup. 
          - The mobile navigation bar is always visible on small screens, but
            not shown on the landing page by dafault, only after a scroll down..
          - The Compact navigation bar with visible nav items is always shown, 
            even on the home page, when the user scrolls and has enough space
            (not a small screen), hiding/showing is done with smooth
            transitions..
          - Category landing page fix: able to display larger areas for blog
            post cards.
          - Better header styling for article headers on small screens (font
            size, spacing).

          look and feel.
        * If 'navigation' is set, on mobile displays, a hamburger menu is

          displayed as a popup menu.
        * Widgets now log what they do in Dancer2's logging system.
        * (CSS) Blog post header has a nice styling even when no feature image

           with a maximum width of 320px and minimum width of 280px;

        * (CSS) Images adapt their width to small screens.
        * All routes for articles, pages, categories are now forced to their
          trailing slash version (/some/article/). Requests to the version
          without a trailing / are redirected. Needed to allow images loeaded
          locally from article locations.
        * (CSS) Activities Cards sizes are now stable to 280px. Responsiveness
          is good now.

          value of the 'image' parameter is relative.
        * It's now possible to mount the Blog widget to the root of the site
          (/). This was causing many bugs in permalinks generation. Fixed now.
