        * Widgets now log what they do in Dancer2's logging system.
        * (CSS) Blog post header has a nice styling even when no feature image
          is set.

        * (CSS) Images adapt their width to small screens.
        * All routes for articles, pages, categories are now forced to their
          trailing slash version (/some/article/). Requests to the version
          without a trailing / are redirected. Needed to allow images loeaded
          locally from article locations.
        * (CSS) Activities Cards sizes are now stable to 280px. Responsiveness
          is good now.

          good now.
        * Fix article->image accessor to return proper permalinks if the meta
          value of the 'image' parameter is relative.
        * It's now possible to mount the Blog widget to the root of the site
          (/). This was causing many bugs in permalinks generation. Fixed now.
