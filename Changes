        [FEATURES]
        * New route to render static assets in article's directory (eg: 
          /blog/some-article/featured.jpg). 
        * New method <render_client_error> to properly render 404 in Liteblog's
          look and feel.
        * If 'navigation' is set, on mobile displays, a hamburger menu is
          displayed. When the user clicks on it, the navigation items are
          displayed as a popup menu.

        [FIXES]
        * All routes for articles, pages, categories are now forced to their
          trailing slash version (/some/article/). Requests to the version
          without a trailing / are redirected. Needed to allow images loeaded
          locally from article locations.
        * (CSS) Activities Cards sizes are now stable to 280px. Responsiveness
          is good now.
        * (CSS) blog-cards sizes are now stable (420px max). Responsiveness is
          good now.
        * Fix article->image accessor to return proper permalinks if the meta
          value of the 'image' parameter is relative.
