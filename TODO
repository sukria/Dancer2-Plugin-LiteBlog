      Caching : articles, blog, all widget instances should not be rebuilt at
      each request. Currently, each time a permalink is called, an Article
      instance is created, the yaml and markdown files are parsed, etc. This
      should be cached in the worker's memory, at least via an option.

      The landing page shows the mobile navigation bar on scrolling. 
      This is not good. The single-page bar should be shown instead.
      This implies a refactoring of the navigation bars by merging
      the logic of single-page.css and liteblog.css.
