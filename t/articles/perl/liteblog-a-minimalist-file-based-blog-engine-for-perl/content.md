It's been over a decade since I dived into Perl. When the time came to revamp my
personal site, Wordpress felt too heavy. That's when I noticed the Dancer core
team rolled out Dancer2 1.0.0. Big applause to them! 

I gave it a try andâ€¦ Well, just like the old times: it was so much fun!
In no time, I had a basic homepage setup.

As I delved deeper, an idea struck - why not turn this into a plugin? That's how
Dancer2::Plugin::LiteBlog was born. In this article,

## Some sub title 

Test of _some text in italic_ and then *some text in bold*. I think we can also
add a list with some elements : 

  * One element here and [Some link here](https://example.com)
  * Another element with _underline text_

Here I can add a quote:

> Kill your babies. 
> This is a quote from Stephen King.

And some regular paragraph to finish this test article.

<pre><code class="perl">
# Your Perl code goes here
print "Hello, world!";
</code></pre>
